Chrome adds a ‘volume’ icon to browser tabs that are playing audio in the background.

![‘Volume’ tab icon]({{ site_url }}/images/posts/chrome-volume.png){: layout="responsive" }

And that’s not all. A ‘recording’ icon appears in place of the ‘volume’ icon when your webcam is being accessed.

![‘Recording’ tab icon]({{ site_url }}/images/posts/chrome-recording.png){: layout="responsive" }
