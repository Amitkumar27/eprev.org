This is excerpts from “[Why Waiting Is Torture](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html)” by Alex Stone, The New York Times.

Isn’t it brilliant?!

> Occupied time (walking to baggage claim) feels shorter than unoccupied time (standing at the carousel).

This is also why there are mirrors next to elevators and packs of gum along supermarket checkout aisles.
